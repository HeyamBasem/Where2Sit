# 🎯 Smart Seat Picker App – React + AI Recommendation System

This is a full-stack project that helps users pick the **perfect stadium seat** based on their preferences. It features a **React frontend** and a **Python backend** powered by a machine learning recommendation system.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **React frontend** presents users with a dynamic form that asks questions about age, preferences (e.g., near bathrooms, less noise), and special needs (e.g., disabilities).
2. Upon form submission, user data is sent to the **backend**, which:
   - Uses a trained **AI recommendation model (SVD)** built on synthetic data.
   - Matches users with the best seats based on historical preferences and ratings.
   - Returns the best-fitting seat with predicted satisfaction.
